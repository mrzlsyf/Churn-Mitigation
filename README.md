# 💳 Churn Mitigation 🏪
🚀 This project aims to predict customer churn using machine learning models by analyzing both behavioural and demographic data.

---

## 📖 Project Narrative
With the increasing number of users, many are acquired solely to meet the company's user target at **Fashion Campus**. The Marketing Team has been tasked with creating attractive promotions to draw user attention. However, this has led to a rise in non-organic users who do not return to the platform for transactions, increasing the user churn rate.

The **Data Science Team** has been assigned to analyze this issue by developing a churn prediction model. The provided data includes **demographic information, transactions, and clickstream data**. The team is expected to create various features to ensure model accuracy while considering all possible user behaviours and interactions.

---

## 🎯 Overview
This project performs the following key tasks:
1. **Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering** 🛠️
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for Customer Insights** 📊
3. **Machine Learning Model Implementation for Churn Prediction** 🤖
4. **Model Evaluation & Performance Analysis** 📈

This predictive analytics approach helps businesses identify customers who are likely to churn and develop targeted retention strategies.

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset consists of four CSV files:
- **click_stream.csv**  : Contains user interactions with the platform.
- **transactions.csv**  : Records customer purchase history.
- **customer.csv**      : Includes demographic details of customers.
- **product.csv**       : Provides product-related data.

These datasets are merged and preprocessed to create relevant features for churn prediction.

## 🏠 Project Workflow 📌
1. **Data Collection & Cleaning** 🧹
   - Load datasets and handle missing values.
   - Merge datasets to create a comprehensive customer profile.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** 🔍
   - Identify key features correlated with churn.
3. **Feature Engineering & Model Training** 🏗️
   - Extract meaningful features from raw data.
   - Train ML models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.).
4. **Model Evaluation & Deployment** 🚀
   - Evaluate model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC-ROC.
